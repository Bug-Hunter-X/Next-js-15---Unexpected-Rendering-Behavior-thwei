# Next.js 15 - Unexpected Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle rendering bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application.  The application fails to render correctly, and debugging the issue requires careful examination of data fetching and component lifecycles.

## Bug Description

The main issue is an unexpected rendering behavior in the `pages/index.js` file.  The page does not render as expected, and standard debugging methods have not yet identified the root cause. This bug may be related to data fetching or component composition.

## Solution

A proposed solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  This solution includes improved data management to mitigate and resolve the rendering inconsistencies observed in the original code.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the unexpected rendering behavior in your browser.
